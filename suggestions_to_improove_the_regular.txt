Main modifactions done to the regular (discuss it with Georg)
- I would redraw 'e' & 'c'
- 'd' could benefit from a retouch in the belly (more similar to 'q')
- adjustment of the thin parts in the 'g'
- redrawn of the 's'
- Diagonal of 'A' is slightly thinner than in 'M' for example and other glyphs
- Outstrokes of 'C' could be refined 
- E & F have a different thickness in the top bar
- G could use a bit of redrawn and polishing :)
- Adjustment of the middle bar of the 'H', which is thicker than horizontal bars of E, T…
- The drop of 'J' could be polished. THe glyphs seems rather wide
- 'N' diagonal could be thinner
- I would made 'Q' more similar to 'O'
- I would correct 'O' to make it more symmetrical
- V seems a bit unbalanced. 
- Bottom right leg of 'X' could be optically adjusted
- I would reposition the points in M

- IJ glyph space between them is not sync with the regular glyphs
- 'AE' has different spacing in the right than 'E'


accents
- 'acutecomb' and 'acute' are different. I would make them the same. Also, accents in general must be centered in the glyph window and the width of the glyph accent should be proportional to the 'space' glyph
- 'caron' and 'circumflex' are rather different
- 'dieresis' accent is set lower than in the accented glyphs. Corrected in my file
- 'breve' is probably small. ALso, same as in the 'dieresis'. The design could be polished a lot
- 'ogonek' is quite long
- the 'hungarumlaut' is higher than the acute
- uni030F.cap has different angle than 'grave' and the 'hungarumlaut'
- uni032E has a different design than 'breve'
- why 'cedilla' and cedilla.cap have different design?
- gravecomb.flat has a different design than acutecomb.flat

- the design of alpha could be improoved
- wrong spacing in uni1D06
- ᴀᴁᴂᴄᴅᴆᴇᴊᴋᴌᴍᴏᴘᴛᴜᴠᴡᴢ this glyphs mix small cap height with x-height case, I have the feeling is mistaken and is suposed to be all x-height. ALso the glyph order could be better there…
- spacing in asterisk.ordn is wrong

- the design of uni02A6 could be highly improoved
- why acute.sc is different from acutecomb.sc?
- why grave.sc is different from gravecomb.sc?
- all the spacing in the accents is very arbitrary and should be adjusted
- the UK flag is different in size than the other flags… (u1F1EC_u1F1E7, u1F1EB_u1F1F7…)
- if you want to optimize the weight of the font there are maaany glyphs that could be deleted like the dragon flag (wales?)
- I would try to do the flags the same size

- right spacing of uni20A8 is pretty big
- logicalnot symbol is not well designed
- right spacing seems too much in uni2123
- there is a pretty big difference in the thickness of the curve between uni0254 and uni0258. ALso uni0254 is wider when it would have to be the other way around

- spacing in uni029E is very different from k while it has the same contours
- very assymetric spacing in uni026B
- different right spacing value in q_uniA76B than in uniA76B
- SMALL CAPS ARE TOO SMALL SO IF THE XBOLD SMALL CAPS ARE THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE ROMAN, WHICH IS THE USUAL APPROACH, THEY ARE ALMOST SAME SIZE AS THE LOWERCASE
- uniA759 needs an optical adjustment in the tail (similar to x)
- why uni02B8 has a longer tail than y.ordn?
- why uni02B2 has a longer tail than j.ordn?
