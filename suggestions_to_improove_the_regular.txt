Main modifactions done to the regular (discuss it with Georg)
- I would redraw 'e' & 'c'
- 'd' could benefit from a retouch in the belly (more similar to 'q')
- adjustment of the thin parts in the 'g'
- redrawn of the 's'
- Diagonal of 'A' is slightly thinner than in 'M' for example and other glyphs
- Outstrokes of 'C' could be refined 
- E & F have a different thickness in the top bar
- G could use a bit of redrawn and polishing :)
- Adjustment of the middle bar of the 'H', which is thicker than horizontal bars of E, Tâ€¦
- The drop of 'J' could be polished. THe glyphs seems rather wide
- 'N' diagonal could be thinner
- I would made 'Q' more similar to 'O'
- I would correct 'O' to make it more symmetrical
- V seems a bit unbalanced. 
- Bottom right leg of 'X' could be optically adjusted
- I would reposition the points in M

- IJ glyph space between them is not sync with the regular glyphs


accents
- 'acutecomb' and 'acute' are different. I would make them the same. Also, accents in general must be centered in the glyph window and the width of the glyph accent should be proportional to the 'space' glyph
- 'caron' and 'circumflex' are rather different
- 'dieresis' accent is set lower than in the accented glyphs. Corrected in my file
- 'breve' is probably small. ALso, same as in the 'dieresis'
- 'ogonek' is quite long
