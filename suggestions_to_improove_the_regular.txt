Main modifactions done to the regular (discuss it with Georg)
- I would redraw 'e' & 'c'
- 'd' could benefit from a retouch in the belly (more similar to 'q')
- adjustment of the thin parts in the 'g'
- redrawn of the 's'
- Diagonal of 'A' is slightly thinner than in 'M' for example and other glyphs
- Outstrokes of 'C' could be refined 
- E & F have a different thickness in the top bar
- G could use a bit of redrawn and polishing :)
- Adjustment of the middle bar of the 'H', which is thicker than horizontal bars of E, T…
- The drop of 'J' could be polished. THe glyphs seems rather wide
- 'N' diagonal could be thinner
- I would made 'Q' more similar to 'O'
- I would correct 'O' to make it more symmetrical
- V seems a bit unbalanced. 
- Bottom right leg of 'X' could be optically adjusted
- I would reposition the points in M

- IJ glyph space between them is not sync with the regular glyphs
- 'AE' has different spacing in the right than 'E'


accents
- 'acutecomb' and 'acute' are different. I would make them the same. Also, accents in general must be centered in the glyph window and the width of the glyph accent should be proportional to the 'space' glyph
- 'caron' and 'circumflex' are rather different
- 'dieresis' accent is set lower than in the accented glyphs. Corrected in my file
- 'breve' is probably small. ALso, same as in the 'dieresis'. The design could be polished a lot
- 'ogonek' is quite long
- the 'hungarumlaut' is higher than the acute
- uni030F.cap has different angle than 'grave' and the 'hungarumlaut'
- uni032E has a different design than 'breve'
- why 'cedilla' and cedilla.cap have different design?
- gravecomb.flat has a different design than acutecomb.flat

- uni1E41
- zdotaccent has the accent lower than other similar glyphs
- uni1E64 the position of the accent is clearly wrong

- uni0450 has the accented alightly out of place compared with other similar glyph
- uni0451
- uni04F1
- uni1E90
- uni1E7E the accent seems slightly disaligned
- uni1E88
- uni0189 although base glyph is D has a different design
- uni1FD8 has the position of the accent different to Ibreve
- uni01E4 has a different thickness in the bar to other barred glyphs
- uni2C63 doesn t have a different spacing value in the right side although it has the bar (other similar glyphs has a different spacing value)

- uni1D2D is wrong. It would have to be a modifier, not a regular glyph
- Lslash needs optical adjustment
- 'N' and 'Eng' have different spacing values althought the width of the glyph is the same.
- 'hbar' and 'dcroat' do not have the optical adjustment. Neither do other similar glyphs like uni0180
- aringacute has an adjustment in the ring that seems unnecessary, since there is plenty of room above the glyph
- 'oe' has a rather different design than 'o' and 'e' isolated :S
- uni1D02 has problems in the spacing (different values than 'a' and 'e')
- uni0490 has negative spacing, which means it needs lot of ckerning corrections when the font is set in uppercase :S
- uni01A9, uni0182, summation symbol… and 'E' would have to have similar outstrokes
- uni1EFA has a weird spacing relationship, very different regarding it s contour, with other similar glyphs
- uni0186 could use some adjustments in the serifs
- uni023E spacing issue related to T?
- uni024C spacing issue related to R
- uniA78D spacing isseu related to H
- uni2C75 spacing issue related to E
- uni0220 could use lot of refinement in the curve
- uni0220 weird spacing
- thorn has spacing incoherences
- uni1E03 uni1E0B uni1E1F uni1E23 etc etc have all diferent accent heights! (in general when there is secondary accents involved the heights are quite inconsistent. Fix!)
- uni0287 has a different detail in the bottom compared with the original letter
- uni01AC could need some small fixing in the curves here and there
- Ƕƕ the tail is rather different
- ƠƯ the horns have very different heights
- Upsilon & Upsilon01 have the same design. Why not do a different one?
- the design of uni01A4 compared with 'P' is not very good
- the design of uni019D compared with similar latin glyphs is not very good
- uni01F7 could use some refinements in the curves
- uni01B1 has an axis problem. The current design features a vertical axis while the rest of the font has a slightly slanted axis. ALso is quite assymetrical
- uni01B8 spacing problems in the right. Also point placement could be improoved
- /Adieresis.deu/Odieresis.deu/Udieresis.deu the dots have different size from other dot-accented-caps
- ATTENTION: UDIERESIS.DEU NEEDS SOME PRODUCTION MANEUVERS!
- uni01BC seems to have spacing issues
